# Project #1: Space Fighter Game
Repo: https://git.generalassemb.ly/uxnivek8/palmarius-project-1

### Deliverables

* **Technologies Used**
  - When the project first began last week I used jQuery for reading some of the first game elements and also to test out, without success the animation for projecting the laser beam. Given the unfamiliarity, I soon abandoned it and went back to the more versed syntax of plain JavaScript. So in the end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the programming languages used in completing this game. I had also used Google Chrome's developer tools frequently throughout the programming stages and found it immensely helpful.
